        "question": "When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?",

        "response": "To find the length of a side of the square inscribed in a circle, we start by determining the radius of the circle. Given that the area of the circle is \\(18\\pi\\) square units, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, \\(A = \\pi r^2\\), to find the radius \\(r\\).\n\n1. Set up the equation for the area of the circle:\n   \\[\n   \\pi r^2 = 18\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. Solve for \\(r^2\\):\n   \\[\n   r^2 = 18\n   \\]\n\n3. Take the square root of both sides to find \\(r\\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we use the fact that the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. The diameter \\(d\\) of the circle is twice the radius:\n   \\[\n   d = 2r = 2 \\times 3\\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\nThe diagonal of the square can also be expressed in terms of the side length \\(s\\) of the square using the Pythagorean theorem. For a square, the diagonal \\(d\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = s\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\nSetting the two expressions for the diagonal equal to each other, we get:\n   \\[\n   s\\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\(s\\):\n   \\[\n   s = 6\n   \\]\n\nThus, the length of a side of the square is \\(6\\) units. Therefore, the correct option is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",
